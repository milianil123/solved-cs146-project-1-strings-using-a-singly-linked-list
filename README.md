Note: don’t use collections, like list, HashSet (TreeSet), and TreeSet (TreeMap)

Write a program that implements a set of items (strings) using a singly linked list. A set is a collection of items in which no item occurs more than once. Your project should externally support the following functions:

<ol>

 <li>Add a new item to the set. If the item is already in the set then nothing happens.</li>

 <li>Remove an item from the set.</li>

 <li>Return the number of items in the set.</li>

 <li>Determine if an item is a member of the set.</li>

 <li>Return a reference to each item in the set (given an item)</li>

 <li>Determine the union (i.e. set of all distinct <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Element_(set_theory)">elements</a>) and the intersection (i.e. set of all common distinct <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Element_(set_theory)">elements</a>) of two sets.</li>

</ol>

<ul>

 <li>[extra points 3pts] Create different sets of different data types (for example, strings, integers, or other objects from other comparable classes). Generics.</li>

 <li>Include appropriate JUnit tests. (no main method)</li>

 <li>Count the time it takes to execute each of the above operations. Note: To count the time use system.currentTimeMillis().</li>

</ul>

Programming Standards:

<ul>

 <li>See project rubric on canvas for details.</li>

</ul>

Deliverables:

<ul>

 <li>For JUnit tests check canvas.</li>

 <li>Eclipse, use export project</li>

 <li>Use cs146S21.&lt;lastname&gt;.project1 as your package, and don’t need a main method, only JUnit java tests.</li>

 <li>What to submit to canvas (Steps):</li>

</ul>

○ Export your project on eclipse with your entire project (source code).  Otherwise include a Readme file.

○ Create a zip file named LastnameFirstProjectName.zip that includes the exported zip file + pdf report

○ upload the last zip file to canvas.

<ul>

 <li>All projects need to compile. If your program does not compile you will receive 0 points on this project.</li>

 <li>Add meaningful comments.</li>

 <li>Do not use any fancy libraries. We should be able to compile it under standard installs.</li>

</ul>

Include a readme file on how to compile the project.
